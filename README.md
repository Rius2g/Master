This is my Master thesis:)

## Abstract 
Smart contracts can provide great value in provenance, casual-time ordering and information flow control, but smart contracts are pretty tedious to interact with from normal backend code. Therefore this project contains a smart contract that provides casual-time ordering and information flow control + a backned (golang) package that makes it easy to interact with the smart contract.
